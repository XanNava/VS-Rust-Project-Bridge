# VsRustAutoLink


About
Will create and setup a vs project that will build and runa rust project, and interface with it through console.

Load up the project, it will create the rust vs project, and setup the enviroment, and setup the build commands.

It will launch a vs 2026 instance for the new project, if you hit plasy the rust porgram will be wrapped around the console that opens.

For them you can see the rust terminal program we made from the wrapping project.

So yes, this is a project that creates a project for easy templating.
